\section{Introduction}

Here, write a brief introduction to the problem you are solving. This can be adapted from your problem description and motivation from the original proposal. This should be around 0.25-0.5 pages.

\section{Related Work}

Here, talk about the related work you encountered for your approach. Cite at least 5 references. Refer to item 2. No one has done exactly your task? Write about the most similar thing you can find. This should be around 0.25-0.5 pages.

\section{Dataset}

%You should write about your dataset here, following the guidelines 
%regarding item 1. This section may be 0.5-1 pages. Depending on your 
%specific dataset, you may want to include subsections for the preprocessing, 
%annotation, etc.

The mono depth perception project is using the KITTI Depth Vision Benchmark Suite. 
This dataset contains over 93,000 gray scale depth maps along with corresponding
RGB images and LiDAR scans. The LiDAR scans provide accurate depth information 
which is used to generate the ground truth depth maps. The resolution of the RGB images
is 1242 x 375 pixels with 3 color channels for red, green, and blue. The depth maps
are single channel images with the same resolution as the RGB images, where each pixel
value represents the distance from the camera to the object in meters up to a 80 meter maximum.

The following images are a single example from the dataset.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{rgb_image_0.png}
  \caption{An example RGB image from the KITTI dataset.}
  \label{fig:kitti_rgb}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{depth_map_0-modified.png}
  \caption{The corresponding ground truth depth map for the RGB image in Figure~\ref{fig:kitti_rgb}. (Inverted for visualization purposes)}
  \label{fig:kitti_depth}
\end{figure}

The depth maps in the KITTI dataset have some missing values due 
to the limitations of the LiDAR sensor. The point clouds generated by 
the LiDAR tend to be sparse, especially for objects that are far away from the sensor.
Since the KITTI dataset also contains stereo images, the authors of the dataset
also use stereo reconstruction and semi-global matching. In their results,
they report achieving a better Mean Absolute Error (MAE) when combining LiDAR data
with stereo reconstruction, compared to using LiDAR data alone.

The dataset may be downloaded from the official KITTI website\footnote{http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval\_depth.php}
using their provided script and is already split into training and validation sets by the authors.
To retrieve the required dataset, the raw RGB images must be downloaded
separately from the depth maps. Some preprocessing was required to remove
RGB images that did not have corresponding depth maps. 


\section{Features}

Describe any features you used for your model, or how your data was input to your model. Are you doing feature engineering or feature selection? Are you learning embeddings? Is it all part of one neural network? Refer to item 2. This may range from 0.25 pages to 0.5 pages.

\section{Implementation}

Describe your model and implementation here. Refer to item 4. This may take around a page.

\section{Results and Evaluation}

How are you evaluating your model? What results do you have so far? What are your baselines? Refer to item 5. This may take around 0.5 pages.

\section{Feedback and Plans}

Write about your plans for the remainder of the project. This should include a discussion of the feedback you received from your TA, and how you plan to improve your approach. Reflect on your implementation and areas for improvement. Refer to item 6. This may be around 0.5 pages.

\section{Template Notes}

You can remove this section or comment it out, as it only contains instructions for how to use this template. You may use subsections in your document as you find appropriate.

\subsection{Tables and figures}

See Table~\ref{citation-guide} for an example of a table and its caption.
See Figure~\ref{fig:experiments} for an example of a figure and its caption.

    Example image is usually available through the \texttt{mwe} package
    without even mentioning it in the preamble.}

\subsection{Citations}

\begin{table*}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \hline
    \textbf{Output}           & \textbf{natbib command} & \textbf{ACL only command} \\

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{citation-guide}

  }
\end{table*}

Table~\ref{citation-guide} shows the syntax supported by the style files.
We encourage you to use the natbib styles.
You can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text) to get ``author (year)'' citations, like this citation to a paper by \citet{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citep| (cite in parentheses) to get ``(author, year)'' citations \citep{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citealp| (alternative cite without parentheses) to get ``author, year'' citations, which is useful for using citations within parentheses (e.g. \citealp{Gusfield:97}).

\subsection{References}

\nocite{Ando2005,andrew2007scalable,rasooli-tetrault-2015}

Many websites where you can find academic papers also allow you to export a bib file for citation or bib formatted entry. Copy this into the \texttt{custom.bib} and you will be able to cite the paper in the \LaTeX{}. You can remove the example entries.

\subsection{Equations}

An example equation is shown below:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:example}
  A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}

Labels for equation numbers, sections, subsections, figures and tables
are all defined with the \verb|\label{label}| command and cross references
to them are made with the \verb|\ref{label}| command.
This an example cross-reference to Equation~\ref{eq:example}. You can also write equations inline, like this: $A=\pi r^2$.
